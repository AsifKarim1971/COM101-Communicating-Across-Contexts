The task: Create a one-page infographic with a title and subsections that informs the viewer about the central message and supporting evidence from the article. Your infographic should be attractive and effective at communicating its message. YOU MUST also include a References list with the sources of your images listed in APA style.


NOTE - This is a visual presentation, NOT a writing assignment.  Limit wording to a MINIMUM. There should be NO PARAGRAPHS in the infographic. Use words, phrases and VERY SHORT sentences. Marks will be deducted for too much wording. 


Assignment Description: Use Pikto, PowerPoint, Canva, Google slides, or another visual layout software program to create an attractive and colourful visual message containing the main ideas and supporting ideas in the article. Information on how to use Canva is under this module.

What have you already learned in this course that will help you? - Your infographic is like a summary, but with IMAGES, CHARTS, LISTS, AND BULLET POINTS rather than a paragraph with sentences. 
NONE OF YOUR OWN OPINIONS are included. 


Your Purpose: Your infographic's purpose is to visually represent the main idea and supporting ideas of the article in a way that is clear and easy to understand. You need to both inform and persuade. That is, your infographic should attempt to highlight the central ideas of the article, while presenting those ideas in a way that is persuasive, creating interest for your audience and convincing them of the points in the article. Paraphrase the key points in clear, easy, concise, accessible language for a general audience.


Title: The title of your infographic should be a thesis or central message of the article.  Usually, an article contains only part of the main idea and is only a few words in length.

DO NOT SIMPLY USE THE ARTICLE TITLE AS THE TITLE OF YOUR INFOGRAPHIC!


Graphics: Select and integrate three or more well-selected (appropriate to the content and to a general audience) images to help illustrate your main ideas. Your images can include:
•	a pie chart or graph
•	a clip-art, illustration or cartoon image or anything you feel would work
Design: Colour, contrast and design are key in presenting an appealing infographic. Take your design into account so that your infographic draws in your reader, and they can quickly and easily determine your message. 


Your Audience: Imagine you are creating your infographic to be posted to the College website. It needs to look professional; it needs to be accurate; it needs to be clear; and it ought to be visually appealing and appropriate in order to connect with students at Seneca. Ask yourself: What would be appealing and appropriate for you and other students in your classes?
Your Tone:  This is a casual style of assignment. You are not writing an academic summary here; you are summarizing something to be presented visually. It should be visually appealing. Don't make it too casual however, as not all students would related to slang, short forms or acronyms.


References: (Include a "Source" line at the bottom): If your Sources don't fit on the page with your infographic, put them on another page. Hand both pages in together.
All images under copyright must be cited your images.
Rubric – will be posted under week 10 module. Please review it.
